See code comments for a refresher on Naive Bayesian
Classifiers. To install, simply:

    $ make install

To test, use:

    $ make test

To use the classifier, first you must create some classes
and train it:

    import . "bayesian"

    const (
        Good Class = "good"
        Bad Class = "bad"
    )
    
    classifier := NewClassifier(Good, Bad)
    goodStuff := []string{"tall", "rich", "handsome"}
    badStuff  := []string{"poor", "smelly", "ugly"}
    classifier.Learn(goodStuff, Good)
    classifier.Learn(badStuff,  Bad)

Then you can ascertain the probabilities of each class and
the most likely class your data belongs to:

    scores, likely, _ := classifier.Score(
                            []string{"tall", "girl"}
                         )
