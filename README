See code comments for a refresher on Naive Bayesian
Classifiers. To install, simply:

    $ make install

To use the classifier, first you must create some classes
and train your classifier:

    import "bayesian"

    const (
        Good bayesian.Class = "good"
        Bad bayesian.Class = "bad"
    )
    
    classifier := bayesian.NewClassifier(
                    bayesian.Class[]{Good, Bad}
                  )

    classifier.Learn(
            []string{"tall", "rich", "handsome"}, Good
            )
    classifier.Learn(
            []string{"poor", "smelly", "ugly"}, Bad
            )

Then you can ascertain the probabilities of each class and
the most likely class your data belongs to:

    scores, likely, _ := classifier.Score(
                            []string{"tall", "girl"}
                         )
